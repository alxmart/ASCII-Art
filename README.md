# Project ASCII-Art
ASCII art is a drawing technique that uses a combination of different keyboard characters to create both simple and complex images.  In this project, I'm using print statements to create my own ASCII art image in Kotlin. This is the first project from Codecademy's Learn Kotlin course.
